 
 Any DB Factory
 
 This will abstract the layer between database and application 
 helping to choose from different database without changing application code.

 Implements the concept of factories and deals with the problem of creating objects or connecting to any database without 
 specifying the exact class of object that will be created. 
 The essence of this pattern is to "Define an interface for creating an object,
 but let the classes that implement the interface decide which class to instantiate.
